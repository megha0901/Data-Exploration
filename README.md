# Data-Visualization-of-Covid-19
 I embarked on a data-driven journey to visually dissect the pandemic's impact. Leveraging the capabilities of Tableau, I transformed raw COVID-19 data into compelling visualizations that unveiled the virus's trends and patterns. These interactive dashboards and charts provided a dynamic platform for stakeholders to explore infection rates, vaccination progress, and geographical hotspots. The power of visualization not only made complex data more accessible but also allowed for real-time monitoring and a deeper understanding of the pandemic's nuances. By translating numbers and statistics into engaging visuals, this project equipped decision-makers with the insights needed to make informed choices and strategize effectively in response to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.
